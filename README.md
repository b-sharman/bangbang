This is a very old project that I've recently (2023â€“2024) refactored into a
pretty nice codebase, and probably the largest personal project I have ever
worked on.

## How can I try it?

By installing it locally.

I haven't gotten around to properly packaging this thing, so for now, just
install from the `requirements.txt`.

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/b-sharman/bangbang.git # for HTTPS
```
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:b-sharman/bangbang.git # for SSH
```

2. Make and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
$ cd bangbang
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```sh
$ pip install requirements.txt
```

3. Start a server:
```sh
$ cd bangbang
$ python server.py
```

4. Then, from another terminal or another computer on the same LAN, start
   client(s) using the IP address listed by the server:
```sh
$ python bangbang.py [ip]
```

5. Type `start` from the server instance.
